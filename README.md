[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kmerfeld/cardgame.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kmerfeld/cardgame)

This aims to be a simple cardgame with mechanics simular to 
mtg or hearthstone.

The thing that will set this apart is this will be played only 
in a tournament setting. 


Run the following to test 
```bash
cd common
cargo build
./target/debug/cardgame client
```
