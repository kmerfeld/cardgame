  # This is used to determine what mana costs a card will spawn with, and how many stat
  # points it will have.
  # The first column is the mana cost a card will get,
  # The second column is the probability it will spawn at that mana cost
  # the third is how many stat points are awarded at that level.
  # Note: you get all stat points from levels under you,
  # if a card costs 5, it will get the points from 1,2,3,4 and 5

  # Once a cards mana cost is determined, it rolls on this table to gain 
  # health, attack, and abilities.
  # the first column is the mana cost,
  # the second is the chance to gain an ability,
  # the third is the chance to gain an attack point
  # the fourth is the chance to gain a health point
  # Note: if a card is level 5, it will roll on the 1 mana cost row for each
  # mana point awarded from init_stats at mana cost 1, then it will roll on 
  # cost 2 however many times init_stats tells it to, then 3, 4, and finally 5,
  # 
  # This stat can be used to shape the general path that a card gains stats,
  # You could have a class that heavily gains stats at cost 1-5, then gains abilities
  # for the next 5 mana costs
